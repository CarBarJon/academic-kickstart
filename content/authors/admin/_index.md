I’m a graduate of the Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). My current project in MorenoLab involves the analysis of identity-by-descent genomic segments to determine the population structure of Mexico and their implications in biomedical traits using the data from the Mexican BioBank. I am also involved in other projects as the Oceanian Genome Variation Project. I like photography, surrealist paintings, and good-looking cocktails, I also love rats; one of my dreams is to have a pet rat named Bojack. Is this working?
